So many moving parts here...  
  
I work on this directly in site-packages in a venv... so installation instructions will be lacking for a while.  I want to put it in an LXC container with a shared GUI, but that is so a thing for later unless someone does it for me.  
  
As best I remember, dependencies are:  
python-magic  
pyelftools  
my fork of the distorm3 python wrapper that works with python3  
pygi  
I think everything else is baked in.  I'll bake the others in except for pygi eventually...  
For now my time is better spent on making it work.  
  
The blog to track this project among other things: http://randomsoftware.tumblr.com

I want to get it to a basic functional ELF use case before I start going for funding.
If you want to though, it's here: pledgie, patreon  
  
Pledgie is for "I just want it to do this one thing." or "Thanks."  
Patreon is for "Just don't stop...  this has the makings of pure awesome."  
  
It could be useful for:  
Organizations that need LOADS of licenses - think governments and NGOs.  
Colleges.  
Countries to which Hexrays no longer sells.  
Countries which cannot afford a thousand dollar license.  
The open source community at large.  
  
Notes:  
I don't care about pylint scores.  If it reads as elegant, then it is.  
I need help.  Send me a mail or write a plugin or ten...  
  
Written in Sublime-text, which is also an awesome project.  
  
Documentation:  
Browse the source tree.  I'm putting template classes in documentation so you can subclass a naked instance of most things.  If I don't need to subclass it, I assume you don't either.  If you see something that needs a template, tell me.
